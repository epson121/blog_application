blog_application in Rails

This is my attempt on making a blog application in Rails. I am planning on finishing it in the next couple of months.
It can't be any sooner because of my other obligations, but I will try to do it.

Currently what it does is this:
  - lists blogs on the homepage
  - allows for basic CRUD operations on blog posts
     -creation of blog posts
     -deletion of blog posts
     -update of blog posts
  - has a built-in rich text formatter
